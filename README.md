# 🏗️ MetaNest Blocks

## 📌 Project Title
**MetaNest Blocks**

## 📖 Project Description
MetaNest Blocks is a decentralized real estate registry system built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It allows users to **register**, **transfer**, and **update** virtual or real-world property details in a transparent and tamper-proof way.  

By leveraging blockchain technology, this project ensures that property ownership data remains immutable, verifiable, and securely stored.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To create a **decentralized property management ecosystem** that eliminates fraud, promotes transparency, and simplifies ownership transfer through blockchain-based smart contracts.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Register Property:** Users can add their property details such as name, location, and value.  
- **Transfer Ownership:** Property owners can securely transfer ownership to another address.  
- **Update Value:** Owners can modify property valuation when required.  
- **Blockchain Transparency:** All transactions are recorded immutably on-chain.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrate with **NFT-based property tokens** to enable fractional ownership.
- Connect with **metaverse platforms** for virtual land management.
- Add **DeFi integration** for property-backed lending.
- Implement **oracle services** for real-time market valuation updates.
